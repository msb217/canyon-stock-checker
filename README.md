Sends Discord notifications if specified Canyon models in specified sizes are in stock - ideally, run on a crontab. I used this quick script to help purchase a new Canyon Speedmax during the COVID stockouts. By the time someone stumbles upon this it will need to be updated to account for Canyon site changes.
