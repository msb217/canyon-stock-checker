Sends Discord notifications if specified Canyon models in specified sizes are in stock. I ran this quick script on a cron schedule to help purchase a new Canyon Speedmax during the COVID stockouts. By the time someone stumbles upon this it will need to be updated to account for Canyon website changes.
